For building the container, in this directory forst do the following 2 lines


     git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/Community-AMARETTO.git
     git checkout Community_AMARETTO_for_GenePattern    

Thsi is to avoid double-checking-in of this code until such time as the docker container can access it directly.
